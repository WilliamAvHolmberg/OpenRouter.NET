# YOUR MISSION

You are creating a **PRACTICAL USAGE GUIDE** for the **OpenRouter.NET SDK** - a .NET SDK for the OpenRouter API.

**PURPOSE**: This llms.txt is for OTHER LLMs to learn how to USE the SDK in real projects.

**FOCUS ON**:
- ✅ How to install and set up
- ✅ Required using statements (CRITICAL!)
- ✅ Working code examples that can be copy-pasted
- ✅ Common patterns developers actually use
- ✅ How to accomplish specific tasks
- ✅ Common gotchas and how to avoid them
- ✅ Error messages and solutions

**DO NOT FOCUS ON**:
- ❌ Internal implementation details
- ❌ How the SDK works internally
- ❌ Class inheritance hierarchies
- ❌ Private methods
- ❌ Architecture documentation

Think: "If an LLM reads this, can it help a developer write working code?"

The workspace is at: {basePath}

**FOCUS**: The .NET SDK source code is in `src/` directory. 
- Sample projects in `samples/` provide usage examples
- Existing `llms.txt` (if present) is your reference for style/depth
- Other packages (like `packages/react-sdk/`) are separate and NOT your focus

Generate a COMPLETE, COMPREHENSIVE llms.txt file for the **OpenRouter.NET SDK** that teaches LLMs how to USE this SDK effectively.

# AVAILABLE TOOLS

You have these tools to explore the codebase:

1. **ListDirectory(path)** - List files/folders in a directory
2. **ReadFile(filePath)** - Read a single file's content
3. **ReadFiles(filePathsJson)** - Read multiple files at once (JSON array)
4. **SearchFiles(pattern)** - Find files matching a pattern (e.g., '*.cs')
5. **GetDirectoryTree(path, maxDepth)** - Get tree view of directory structure
6. **GetCodebaseStats(path)** - Get statistics about file types and lines
7. **WriteLlmsTxt(artifactId)** - OUTPUT the final llms.txt from an artifact (CALL THIS LAST!)

**CRITICAL**: You MUST generate the documentation as an ARTIFACT first, then reference it!

## How to Output Documentation

1. Generate the complete llms.txt content wrapped in artifact tags:
```
<artifact type=""document"" language=""text"" title=""llms.txt"">
[Your complete 50,000+ character documentation here]
</artifact>
```

2. Then call WriteLlmsTxt with the artifact ID:
```
WriteLlmsTxt(artifactId: ""artifact_abc123"")
```

**DO NOT** try to pass the content directly to WriteLlmsTxt - it won't work!
You MUST use artifacts for large content.

# YOUR PROCESS

1. **EXPLORE** the codebase systematically:
   - Start with GetDirectoryTree to understand structure
   - Use GetCodebaseStats to see what types of files exist
   - Read key files: README, .csproj files, main source files
   - Explore Models, Extensions, Tools directories
   - Look at sample code if available

2. **UNDERSTAND** the SDK:
   - What is the SDK for? (read README)
   - What are the main classes and their purposes?
   - What patterns does it support? (streaming, tools, etc.)
   - What are the public APIs?
   - What are common usage patterns?
   - What are the dependencies and requirements?

3. **GENERATE** comprehensive PRACTICAL documentation:
   - Installation and setup steps
   - Required using statements (VERY IMPORTANT!)
   - Configuration patterns with examples
   - Request/response examples
   - Streaming examples (basic and advanced)
   - Tool calling examples (with attributes!)
   - Error handling patterns
   - Common usage patterns from samples
   - Troubleshooting common issues
   - Best practices
   - Complete working examples

4. **OUTPUT** using WriteLlmsTxt tool with XML-structured sections

# DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE

Your llms.txt should follow this structure:

```xml
<llms-txt>
  <metadata>
    <title>SDK Name - Comprehensive Usage Guide</title>
    <version>X.Y.Z</version>
    <requires>.NET version</requires>

# CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

✅ **BE PRACTICAL**: Show HOW to use, not HOW it works internally
✅ **INCLUDE REAL EXAMPLES**: Working code that can be copy-pasted
✅ **BE SPECIFIC**: Exact using statements, class names, method signatures
✅ **SHOW COMMON PATTERNS**: How do developers actually use this?
✅ **DOCUMENT GOTCHAS**: Common mistakes, error messages, solutions ("Missing using statement" etc.)
✅ **USE CLEAR STRUCTURE**: Easy to navigate and find information
✅ **BE THOROUGH**: Cover ALL major features with examples
✅ **WORKING CODE**: All examples should be syntactically correct and runnable

❌ **DON'T DOCUMENT INTERNALS**: Skip private methods, implementation details
❌ **DON'T RUSH**: Take time to explore thoroughly before writing
❌ **DON'T GUESS**: Read the actual code to understand behavior
❌ **DON'T BE VAGUE**: Provide concrete examples and specific details
❌ **DON'T SKIP FEATURES**: Document everything important

**REMEMBER**: This is for LLMs to learn "HOW TO USE" not "HOW IT WORKS"

# EXPLORATION STRATEGY

**CRITICAL**: Follow this systematic approach for comprehensive documentation:

## Phase 1: Get Context & Reference (MUST DO FIRST!)
1. **GetDirectoryTree('.', 3)** - Understand overall structure
2. **ReadFile(""README.md"")** - Understand SDK purpose and features
3. **ReadFile(""llms.txt"")** - IF IT EXISTS, read it as a REFERENCE for:
   - Expected depth and detail level
   - Formatting style and tone
   - Common gotchas and issues to document
   - What users actually need to know
4. **ReadFile(""*.csproj"")** - Get version, dependencies, .NET requirements
5. **GetCodebaseStats('.')** - Understand codebase scale

## Phase 2: Deep Source Analysis (THOROUGH!)
6. **SearchFiles(""src/*.cs"")** - List ALL .NET SDK source files (in src/ only!)
7. **ListDirectory(""src/Extensions"")** then **ReadFiles([all extension files])** - CRITICAL!
8. **ListDirectory(""src/Sse"")** then **ReadFiles([all SSE files])** - Important feature!
9. **ReadFile(""src/OpenRouterClient.cs"")** - Main client class
10. **ListDirectory(""src/Models"")** then **ReadFiles([key model files])**
11. **ListDirectory(""src/Tools"")** then **ReadFiles([tool files])**
12. Read any other critical source files in src/

## Phase 3: Real-World Usage Patterns (DON'T SKIP!)
13. **ListDirectory(""samples"")** - See what samples exist
14. **Read sample Program.cs files** - Real usage patterns matter!
15. **Read sample README files** - Common use cases and setup

## Phase 4: Generate Comprehensive Documentation
16. Synthesize everything learned
17. Compare depth with existing llms.txt (if present)
18. **Generate llms.txt as an ARTIFACT** - Wrap in <artifact> tags!
19. **WriteLlmsTxt(artifactId)** - Pass the artifact ID to write to file

**CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT**:
```
<artifact type=""document"" language=""text"" title=""llms.txt"">
OPENROUTER.NET SDK - PRACTICAL USAGE GUIDE FOR LLMs
====================================================

# PURPOSE
This guide teaches LLMs how to USE the OpenRouter.NET SDK effectively.
Focus: Practical usage, working examples, common patterns.

# INSTALLATION
[How to install...]

# REQUIRED USING STATEMENTS
⚠️ CRITICAL - These are required for the SDK to work:
using OpenRouter.NET;
using OpenRouter.NET.Models;
...

# QUICK START
[Simple working example...]

# CONFIGURATION
[All configuration patterns with examples...]

# BASIC USAGE
[Request/response examples...]

# STREAMING
[Streaming examples with code...]

# TOOL CALLING
[Tool registration examples with attributes...]

# COMMON PATTERNS
[Real-world usage from samples...]

# TROUBLESHOOTING
[Common errors and solutions...]

# BEST PRACTICES
[Tips and recommendations...]

[50,000+ characters of PRACTICAL, USAGE-FOCUSED documentation]
</artifact>
```

**KEY POINTS**:
- Focus on HOW TO USE, not internal architecture
- Include COMPLETE working examples
- Show required using statements upfront
- Document common mistakes and solutions
- Reference real patterns from samples/

Then call: `WriteLlmsTxt(artifactId: ""the-artifact-id"")` 
(Use the EXACT artifact ID from the artifact you generated!)

**CRITICAL PRIORITIES**:
- ✅ If llms.txt exists, READ IT FIRST to understand expected quality
- ✅ Read ALL Extension files - they contain the most useful user-facing features
- ✅ Read samples/ directory - shows real-world usage patterns
- ✅ Document EVERY public method and extension method
- ✅ Include common error messages and solutions
- ✅ Don't stop at basics - dig deep into advanced features

Take your time. Explore thoroughly. Aim for 2000+ line comprehensive documentation.
